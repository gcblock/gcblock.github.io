with huge trust cost. The natural decentralization of blockchain technology,
data cannot be tampered with, traceability and other characteristics are
efficient solutions to solve the problem of Internet trust and improve
production efficiency. However, the consensus algorithm adopted by the current
blockchain technology still has problems such as weak decentralization, low
throughput and waste of resources. With the vigorous development of the Internet
of Things and artificial intelligence, enterprises and governments are in urgent
need of developing the blockchain technology, so as to realize the building of
rich upper application and widely recognized blockchain technology.</p> <p>  By studying consensus algorithms such as PoW and DPOS, it is found that they all
have resource-oriented security shortcomings. When resources are centralized, it
means that a single node has a high weight in the public, and the imtamperable
property of blockchain data will be invalid.Entrust the security Certificate
consensus algorithm (Guarantee Certificate) referred to as &quot;GC,
inspired by method of the astronomical Taoism, commissioned in the society and
guarantee the behavior of the chain of responsibility mechanism is constructed
to guarantee the data cannot be tampered with, the client pay the bills, the
guarantor guarantees the bill is valid, the top node honest record client submit
payment chain provide the basis for yourself, the final data aggregation for
payer bill is&quot; inevitable &quot;, legal if not legally initiate collective
arbitration, restriction and accountability for cheaters.Through this
responsibility chain mechanism, multi-direction supervision is formed in the
community to monitor cheating behavior in the blockchain network. User resources
are guaranteed through the accountability mechanism, cheaters are punished, and
attacks bear huge risks. The security capability is not dependent on the
proportion of individual resources, and resource centralization is refused.The
GC consensus algorithm takes the role as the unit of the system, so that a
single node can be deployed in a cluster, and the load capacity of individual
nodes can be improved horizontally.Bills generated by all nodes on the data are
valid data and constitute a responsibility chain to realize value drive. The
payment mode of TPS with low risk and &quot;infinite high&quot; (only considering the
dimensions of consensus, not considering the limitations of hardware and
underlying system dependence) and the payment mode with zero risk waiting for
aggregation confirmation are selected flexibly for risk assessment.In this
paper, the algorithm process will be described in detail around the above
functional points and the flow chart. Based on this theoretical basis, the
blockchain engine based on the chain of responsibility mechanism will be
realized. Finally, whether it meets the theoretical design requirements will be
verified through functional tests and performance tests.</p> <p>  The block chain system developed based on GC consensus algorithm theory can
realize horizontal expansion in throughput capacity after testing. It is driven
by value and does not produce waste data and does not waste resources. As the
underlying database, it can provide on-chain solutions for N types of
industries, build rich block chain applications and improve the efficiency of
multi-industries.</p> <p>  Keywords: Consensus algorithm, Blockchain, Delegation and Guarantee Liability
Chain, GC consensus algorithm</p> <h2 id="chapter-1-introduction"><a href="#chapter-1-introduction" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>Chapter 1 Introduction</strong></h2> <p>  &quot;Consensus&quot; is a term full of philosophical significance. From the bartering of
primitive times, to the issuing of money in the monetary age, even the rule of
the regime is operated by consensus, so that people can participate in the
system after reaching consensus.The robustness of the consensus determines the
efficiency of the operation of the system. Consensus of blockchain refers to
that each node in the network system reaches a consensus through software
algorithm, which makes the blockchain system traceable, tamper-free,
decentralized and other characteristics.The consensus algorithm based on
entrustment and Guarantee agreement is inspired by the Taoist thought of &quot;law,
heaven and earth&quot;, and it is applied to software design by observing the
behavior of Entrust and Guarantee in human society, so as to realize efficient
and safe application of blockchain.Because the design structure is similar to
the social system, it can be different from the private chain and become the
first public chain that can be regulated.</p> <p>  Assume that as the technology development of humans developed a &quot;CD&quot;, as big as
a moon that everyone can see open, data storage, have enough storage unit, and
each storage unit can be written only once, and repeated reading, people will
open books recorded in the above, everyone can participate in accounting, which
implements a everyone involved, data can be traced, and tamper-resistant
completely reliable block chain system.Since every person in this blockchain
system has the right to keep accounts and the data stored in it cannot be
changed, it is in line with the characteristics of decentralized accounting,
traceability of ledger data and non-tampering.And there is no way to cheat to
break these rules, it can be called a completely reliable blockchain system.</p> <p>  At present, only through the consensus mechanism can the characteristics of
decentralized accounting, traceability of data and non-tampering be achieved in
the community system. However the present most block chain system is not fully
reliable, such as, based on the POW, DPOW, DPOS, authority certificate,
certificate of weight consensus algorithm, such as research and development of
block chain system are achieved based on the limited conditions of data
consistency, when an attacker in the hold a certain amount of resources can be
launched &quot;attack&quot; double pay, damage the interests of the recipient's damaged
this consistency.In the real-name system, such behavior is called &quot;overspending&quot;
and the payee can be held responsible without the physical system. In the
non-real-name system, the payee's loss cannot be recovered.These requirements
include that a single node cannot have more than 51 percent of the network's
computing power (in fact, holding 20 percent of the network's computing power
can successfully launch a double-payment attack), that 50 percent of the nodes
are loyal and reliable, and so on.The reality may be more pessimistic, as the
number of online nodes that play a consensus-playing role is usually smaller
than the total number of nodes, and the holders of node resources &quot;vary widely
in wealth&quot;.To sum up the objective conditions, it is concluded that the cost of
launching consensus attack is far less than the theoretical value.This is one of
the main reasons for the development of blockchain technology.</p> <p>  Consensus mechanisms are driven by computationally expensive PoW consensus
algorithms (commonly known as &quot;mining&quot;) such as Bitcoin. Although PoW is a
pioneer of consensus algorithms, it is wasteful and TPS is too low to extend
rich upper-level applications.Because the above 2 features are not up to
standard, it is not recommended.In addition, the security of the algorithm
through proof of stake depends on the honesty of the majority of nodes. In
today's world where the resources of all parties are uneven and the gap is
large, its security is obviously a &quot;heavy task&quot;.GC consensus algorithm based on
guarantee arbitration mechanism can completely avoid this attack.This paper
describes how the Delegated Guaranteed Proof Conconsensus Algorithm is a
value-driven, high-TPS, security independent of node honesty, computational
power, and fully reliable blockchain system by doing valuable work.</p> <h2 id="chapter-2-gc-consensus-algorithm"><a href="#chapter-2-gc-consensus-algorithm" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>Chapter 2: GC consensus algorithm</strong></h2> <p>  This chapter describes GC consensus algorithm through the chain of
responsibility to implement the monitoring mechanism, arbitration mechanism, to
realize the decentralization of blockchain, data can not be tamper with the
characteristics.</p> <h3 id="_2-1-consensus-unit"><a href="#_2-1-consensus-unit" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>2.1 Consensus Unit</strong></h3> <p>  GC Consensus Unit is divided into four categories: Client, Guarantor, Top Node
and Aggregate Node.Each consensus unit is responsible for different algorithms,
so that each node can supervise each other and ensure that the overall data is
honest and reliable and can not be tampered with.</p> <h3 id="_2-1-1-the-principal"><a href="#_2-1-1-the-principal" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>2.1.1 the principal</strong></h3> <p>  The client is the producer of the data, and the data signed by the client can
only be recognized by the GC blockchain system after being guaranteed by the
guarantor, so the client must have a fixed guarantor to cooperate with the
normal business exhibition. In this paper, the guarantor of the client is
described as &quot;the account holder&quot;.Client can not arbitrarily transfer accounts,
transfer application need to freeze after a certain period to take effect, this
time setting is flexible, at the top of the real-name system of chain blocks or
node has a very high credibility, such as the functions of the government units,
can shorten the freeze time, or even cancel the freezing time. The freeze time
considerations are based on the system security Settings, and the release of the
freeze depends on the completion of the aggregation node execution.</p> <h3 id="_2-1-2-the-guarantor"><a href="#_2-1-2-the-guarantor" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>2.1.2 the guarantor</strong></h3> <p>  The name of guarantor means that the data produced by the guarantor is true and
effective and has not been tampered with.The trustor can freeze the assets of
the account and make a public statement as the guarantor to provide guarantee
services. The guarantee ability depends on the quantity of the frozen
assets.When a guarantor receives a large transaction from the principal that
exceeds its guarantee capacity, it can choose other guarantor nodes to form a
joint guarantee.Acceptance of the offer of guarantee by other guarantors is not
mandatory. It is customized by individual terminals. For example, it can be set
to accept a certain guarantor, or it must be signed and approved by top nodes to
form joint guarantee, etc.</p> <h3 id="_2-1-3-top-node"><a href="#_2-1-3-top-node" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>2.1.3 Top Node</strong></h3> <p>  The top node selects the node with the most guarantee ability in the whole
network, and the guarantor role is responsible for it, but it is only
responsible for honestly recording the sequence of the payment chain sent by all
the guarantor nodes, and providing inquiry service to other guarantors.The top
node is an important basis for the receiver node to judge whether the limit of
the guarantor is overspent and whether the payment chain is legal or not.</p> <p>  When a blockchain is initialized, the top node is the first block. The validity
of the signature data of the top node is monitored by the way of periodic
&quot;meeting communication&quot; of the nodes. If the top node cheating, other nodes will
abrogate and re-select the top node by proof.</p> <h3 id="_2-1-4-aggregate-nodes"><a href="#_2-1-4-aggregate-nodes" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>2.1.4 Aggregate nodes</strong></h3> <p>  Aggregate nodes are the nodes used to aggregate payment chains and issue
arbitration claims.When the payment chains are aggregated, cheating nodes will
show &quot;overspend&quot; conflicts. When the node obtains the conflicting payment
chains, it will initiate arbitration and deduct the guarantor deposit to fill
the overspend bill.If the top node is found cheating, the deposit of the top
node will be deducted and its account will be frozen, and then the node with the
most guarantee ability will be re-selected as the top node.If there is no
cheating, all payment chains will be signed by the guarantor as an unalterable
fact.</p> <p>  Aggregation nodes are the ultimate safeguard against cheating, and the frequency
with which they are executed is a key parameter for achieving a public ledger
that is close to completely reliable.</p> <p>  Assume that V represents reliability over a period of time (100% is completely
reliable), that the aggregate data is executed at an interval of t, and that b
is the probability of cheating during this period (the value at risk).Is:</p> <p>V of 1 is equal to B over T</p> <p>  After this time point, the payee will confirm the payment operation, the risk
value will be reduced to 0, that is, it has been recognized as a fact that will
not be tampered with.The concept of entrustment and guarantee is that signing
bills means responsibility. Therefore, due to the existence of supervision, the
real-name blockchain system can improve the transaction efficiency without
waiting for the completion of aggregation to confirm the transaction, because
individuals who overspend will be recovered, and units who overspend will be
held accountable. In the real-name system, the statutory supervision will be the
node with the most guarantee ability, that is, as the top node.</p> <p>  Given the current hardware and software environment, aggregating data too
frequently means overloading the system.Affects the overall throughput of the
system. Under the real-name system, in view of the fact that cheating is
accountability for cost and transaction value under the consideration of small
can need not consider waiting to complete the aggregated data to confirm again,
need only personal terminal according to the approved third party reference node
to provide risk assessment and determine whether to deal, for the big deals,
waiting time of polymerization can be accepted by people.</p> <h3 id="_2-2-gc-algorithm-flow"><a href="#_2-2-gc-algorithm-flow" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>2.2 GC algorithm flow</strong></h3> <p>  Spending side flow diagram, as shown in figure 2-1 assumes that the signature of
the client A launched A to D pay the bill, client will sign the bill sent to A
system, the guarantor node C guarantor after C get bills can verify the
signature is correct, A principal balance is enough, after the basic conditions
to meet will sign the bill after packaged as containing the bill sponsor A chain
of payment data transfer payment notice of (A) to D account guarantor B, B
confirm C guarantee ability, The payment chain is then transmitted to the
guarantor node in the blockchain network with the strongest recognized guarantee
capacity to sign (the top node) to confirm that the payment chain is up to date
and that C's guarantee capacity is greater than the amount of this transaction.</p> <h3 id="_2-1-flow-chart-of-the-client-of-the-spender"><a href="#_2-1-flow-chart-of-the-client-of-the-spender" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2-1 Flow chart of the client of the spender</h3> <p>  The payee D plays A supervisory role in the payment process of A, which is
explained in detail in the section of &quot;Arbitration mechanism to achieve
avoidance of double payment&quot;.If the payee thinks the payment terms are not
credible, it can cancel the transaction by giving up the payment.The signed
order to abandon this transaction will first be sent to C, the account holder of
A, and then C will be responsible for synchronizing to the top node to cancel
the guarantee limit occupied in this transaction.</p> <h3 id="_2-2-schematic-diagram-of-receiver-client"><a href="#_2-2-schematic-diagram-of-receiver-client" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2-2 Schematic Diagram of Receiver Client</h3> <h3 id="_2-2-1-pay-chain"><a href="#_2-2-1-pay-chain" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>2.2.1 pay chain</strong></h3> <p>  The payment chain is a detailed payment list of the payer sorted by timestamp,

expenditure chain, which serves as an important basis for the &quot;arbitration
mechanism&quot;, as shown in Figure 1-1:</p> <p>Figure 1-1 Chain of Responsibility</p> <h3 id="_2-3-arbitration-mechanism-to-achieve-reliable-blockchain"><a href="#_2-3-arbitration-mechanism-to-achieve-reliable-blockchain" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>2.3 Arbitration mechanism to achieve reliable blockchain</strong></h3> <p>  The arbitration mechanism of GC consensus algorithm can avoid the double payment
loophole.Theoretically any node in the liability chain may &quot;mutiny&quot;, but the
arbitration mechanism can protect the rights and interests of the payee.When the
most secure top node &quot;defections&quot; will cause the &quot;payer&quot; to pay more bills than
it can afford.In the case that the total assets of the blockchain remain
unchanged and the non-real name system means that the payee will lose interests.
Arbitration mechanism oriented results have three kinds: the abandonment of the
transaction, the payee 100 percent loss; If the arbitration is successful, the
payee will not lose. Arbitration is successful, but after deducting the
liability of the guarantee money is still not enough to fill up the cheating
part of this transaction.</p> <p>  The cost of cheating is extremely high, and whether or not the cheating is
successful, when the cheating node generates cheating data that is detected and
arbitrated by other nodes means the risk of losing the deposit and freezing the
account. In the real name system, there is even legal liability.</p> <h3 id="_2-3-1-mutiny-of-the-payor-s-guarantor"><a href="#_2-3-1-mutiny-of-the-payor-s-guarantor" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>2.3.1 &quot;Mutiny&quot; of the Payor's Guarantor</strong></h3> <p>  A &quot;defection&quot; by a payer's guarantor is when a payer's bill overruns, but the
payer's account guarantor signs the payment chain to trick the payee into
accepting the transaction by hiding the disbursement or falsifying the income.</p> <p>  This cheating only makes sense if the overspend is greater than the guarantee
plus the payer's balance.Otherwise, the arbitration mechanism will not only
deduct the payer's balance and guarantee amount, but also lock up the account.</p> <p>  It is very risky for the payee to accept this bill without verifying the balance
guaranteed by the payer at the top node.If the other party cheats, the unfilled
part of the arbitration mechanism will be lost.The reason why GC consensus
algorithm does not enforce the verification of top-level nodes is to give a more
flexible experience to the payment network and realize the &quot;check function&quot;.
Whether the final check is valid depends on the reality.</p> <h3 id="_2-3-2-mutiny-of-top-node"><a href="#_2-3-2-mutiny-of-top-node" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>2.3.2 &quot;Mutiny&quot; of Top Node</strong></h3> <p>  By providing false pay top node chain sequence the payer guarantor pay nodes
have the ability to appear to be legitimate, but because the payee is the top
node credit payer's important basis, so the top node cheating data will conflict
with block chain network with a node in the data, found cheating behavior is one
of the important parameters to avoid loss of time.</p> <p>  Again, cheating only makes sense if the overspend is greater than the guarantee
amount + the payers' balance + the top node's guarantee amount.Otherwise, the
arbitration mechanism will not only deduct the payer's balance and guarantee
amount, but also lock the account of the top node, and then aggregate the data
of the whole network to select the new node with the highest guarantee amount.</p> <h2 id="chapter-3-blockchain-system-design-and-implementation"><a href="#chapter-3-blockchain-system-design-and-implementation" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>Chapter 3 Blockchain System Design and Implementation</strong></h2> <p>  Blockchain is a term used in information

verification specification of the system. The private key is used to sign the
data and the public key is used to verify whether the data is signed by the
private key. The public key as the wallet address and the private key are
one-to-one correspondence, and the user identity can be bound in the real-name
blockchain system.</p> <ol><li>Guarantee service module:</li></ol> <p>  Guarantee service module means to provide guarantee service to other nodes,
which requires a fixed network access address and an interface for the client to

entrustor, verify the signature through the signature module, and then
automatically find the account opening party of the entrustor to submit the
data.</p> <p>  The principal can obtain the progress and result of the guarantor's transaction
in real time. The revenue-side trustor can check in real time through the top
node whether the payer has sufficient balance to pay the bill and whether the
payer's guarantor has the guarantee capacity to ensure the legality of the
transaction. At the same time, the revenue client can query the aggregated data
through any network node in the blockchain. If it is found that the payer
overspends and the top node provides false reference data for this transaction,
the problem billing data can be submitted to initiate arbitration.</p> <ol><li>Monitoring module:</li></ol> <p>  The monitoring module is responsible for calculating the validity of the
client's payment chain. The first dimension of monitoring is to check whether
payers are overspending by requesting the top-level node to retrieve the
principal payment chain sorted by the top-level node.The second dimension is to
check whether there is any conflicting data in the reference data returned by
the top-level node after data aggregation. If the existence means that a certain
bill has the risk of invalidation, arbitration can be initiated immediately to
recover the loss.</p> <ol><li>Arbitration module:</li></ol> <p>  The arbitration module plays a role when the monitoring module finds out the
conflicting data of the payment chain. When the payment chain of a client is
found to be overspent after merging with another payment chain, arbitration can
be initiated, and the deposit of a client is deducted and the time set by the
account holder is frozen as a punishment. If the deposit of the top node is not
enough to pay the overspent part, check whether the top node signs the guarantee
amount of the top node. If it is wrong, the top node is judged to be cheating.
The deposit is deducted from the top node to pay the overspent part, and the top
node is discarded and selected again.Assuming the bill is not signed by the top
node, the unfilled overspend in the payee's bill will be lost.</p> <h3 id="_3-3-architectural-design"><a href="#_3-3-architectural-design" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.3 Architectural Design</strong></h3> <p>  A single node is a CS architecture, and the S-side can be clustered to improve

characteristics and development cost of mobile terminal, mobile terminal does
not develop software that independently realizes all functions, but the C
terminal of CS architecture can be mobile terminal.That is, C terminal can call
S terminal to achieve all functions.Users with S-side resources can provide
C-side users with security analysis, aggregated queries, data hosting, and
more.Thus, ecological applications based on S end are extended. For example, S

controlled so that the entire system does not become overloaded frequently.</p> <p>(1) Don't reject data you care about</p> <p>  From the analysis of the aggregate demand, the aggregate data is to monitor
whether there is cheating at the top nodes, while the guarantor is actually more
concerned about the data of the bill principals with their own economy. So a
single node in the GC chain that initiates an aggregation request must first
publish the list of interested clients.When other nodes in the system receive an
aggregation request from a delegate of common interest, they &quot;cannot refuse
(there is no reason to refuse)&quot; to communicate all the data.</p> <p>(2) Do not reject the concerned data, and choose the node with the &quot;strongest
aggregation ability&quot; as the center for data delivery</p> <p>  In order to &quot;nip it in the bud,&quot; each node tends to want to own the entire bill.
But assuming that the system has too many nodes, or that a hacker causes too
many nodes to initiate an aggregation request, satisfying the aggregation
request of all the nodes means that the load on each node in the system is
extremely high and wasteful.</p> <p>  In order to solve this problem, we require the node to not only publish the
relevant data of the client that it cares about, but also publish the data
aggregation of its guarantee when it initiates the aggregation request. The
system sets a certain time interval to consider the aggregation complete.</p> <p>  Because the &quot;care&quot; cascade exists, it means that the aggregation request is made
and the number of aggregation nodes that you care about varies.Here, the node
with the largest number of aggregation nodes is selected as the node with the
&quot;strongest aggregation capability&quot;.</p> <ol><li>Data security</li></ol> <p>  Since the ability to aggregate is strongest and predictable, will the nodes with
the strongest ability to aggregate be turned against? This is a problem that can
be solved 100 percent. A block of data aggregated from any node has the
signature of that node. If tampered, it will be &quot;noticed&quot; by the node that
synchronizes the data at the first time, and the node will be added to the
blacklist. When the data is aggregated again, the blacklisted node will be
permanently removed from the aggregate node.</p> <ol><li>Be responsible for relevant data</li></ol> <p>  When the aggregation is initiated, no matter whether other nodes ask or actively
participate in the aggregation, they shall submit honest payment chain data
guaranteed by themselves. If they are not honest, the part hidden by themselves
will not be accepted by the public, and the part contradictory with other nodes
will be held responsible and punished.Therefore, each node will actively and
honestly publish its own data.</p> <h3 id="_3-5-module-design"><a href="#_3-5-module-design" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.5 Module design</strong></h3> <h3 id="_3-5-1-signature-module"><a href="#_3-5-1-signature-module" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.5.1 Signature module</strong></h3> <p>  GC chain consensus algorithm selects ECC algorithm (elliptic curve algorithm) as

first proposed by Koblitz and Miller in 1985. Its mathematical basis is the

elliptic curve class is sometimes classified as the discrete logarithm
class.Reasons for selection:</p> <p>High safety</p> <p>  Some studies have shown that the 160-bit elliptic key has the same security as
the 1024-bit RSA key.</p> <p>Fast processing speed</p> <p>  In the private key encryption and decryption speed, ECC algorithm is faster than
RSA, DSA.</p> <p>  Small storage footprint.</p> <p>  Low bandwidth requirements.[2]</p> <p>  Reference source: Baidu Baike - Elliptic Encryption Algorithm</p> <h3 id="_3-5-2-guarantee-service-module"><a href="#_3-5-2-guarantee-service-module" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.5.2 Guarantee service module</strong></h3> <p>  Guarantee service is divided into two parts, one is to receive the bill
signature of the client, the other is to accept the payment chain of other
guarantors to form a joint guarantee.The second guaranteed node can be
optionally turned on or off.</p> <p>Accepting Client's Bills:</p> <p>  Calculate the balance of the client, and sign and guarantee the bill when the
balance is sufficient.</p> <p>Accepts payment chains from the principal sent by other guarantors:</p> <p>  According to the parameter setting of the node: simply check the payment chain
of the client and judge the sufficient balance to sign and guarantee; Guarantee
is signed by the top node after signature; The data is aggregated and then
signed for guarantee. Risk levels go down sequentially, but so does throughput
efficiency.</p> <h3 id="_3-5-3-entrusted-business-module"><a href="#_3-5-3-entrusted-business-module" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.5.3 Entrusted business module</strong></h3> <p>  The client gets the payment chain from the guarantor and then calculates the
balance to the presentation layer.To avoid wasting computational resources, a
lock service operation is performed when the client submits multiple invalid
bills.In order to avoid this situation, the entrusting business module will
actively remind the user that the wallet balance is 0 and do not try to issue a
bill.</p> <p>Issue bills:</p> <p>  As shown in figure 1-1, the client is responsible for the bill issued, which is
similar to a bank check.</p> <p>Figure 1-1. Issuing bills</p> <h3 id="_3-5-4-monitoring-module"><a href="#_3-5-4-monitoring-module" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.5.4 Monitoring module</strong></h3> <p>  After the user's blockchain wallet receives the payment, it will check whether
the payer's payment chain has overspent. Overspending means that the payer and
the guarantor are cheating. If the top-level node signs, it means that the
top-level node is also cheating. At this time, the cheating information can be
submitted to the arbitration module for processing.</p> <p>After aggregating the data, the Guarantor will check whether the payment chain
including the Guarantor node and the Guarantor node opening an account at the
current node is overspent, and then do the same as above.</p> <h3 id="_3-5-5-arbitration-module"><a href="#_3-5-5-arbitration-module" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.5.5 Arbitration module</strong></h3> <p>  The mediation transaction will begin immediately after receiving the mediation

this time only need to issue the bill submitted to the arbitration module at the
top of the node to recover losses, the top node after receiving problem bill
will be deducted after confirm true bills the decision of the security deposit,
other nodes synchronize data synchronization when the decision and approval.

architecture cannot be separated from network interaction. GC chain, in line
with the principle of code reuse and low development cost, uses JSON formatted
data body for data interaction, and the interface is realized in a RESTful
style.</p> <h3 id="_3-6-1-signature-module-implementation"><a href="#_3-6-1-signature-module-implementation" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.6.1 Signature module implementation</strong></h3> <p>  In order to reduce the development cost, UNIAPP technology is used for Windows
and data processing on the mobile terminal to realize the signature module and
the entrusted business module, as well as the functions of calling other
guarantor node supervision module and arbitration module.</p> <p>(1) Implementation of asymmetric encryption algorithm</p> <p>  Eosjs-ecc.js is a code library that uses js to implement elliptic curve
encryption algorithms.The call ecc. RandomKey () randomly generates a public and
private key pair. Since the key pair generated by default is too long for human
eyes to recognize, a public key of 121 characters and a private key of 89
characters can be generated after BASE64 encryption.The randomly generated
public key can be applied to the guarantor to open an account and can be used as
the wallet identity of GC chain.</p> <h3 id="_3-6-1-server-side-function-call-module"><a href="#_3-6-1-server-side-function-call-module" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.6.1 Server-side function call module</strong></h3> <p>(1) Implementation of entrusted business module</p> <p>  Use ECC to sign the bill as shown in Figure 1-1 and send it to the Guarantor for

call interface.Since the mobile terminal does not have fixed IP and low
computing power, participation aggregation cannot be realized, but the mobile
terminal can choose the guarantor to realize the functions of supervision module
and arbitration module.</p> <h3 id="_3-7-server-side-implementation"><a href="#_3-7-server-side-implementation" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.7 Server-side implementation</strong></h3> <h3 id="_3-7-1-implementation-of-signature-and-delegation-business-module"><a href="#_3-7-1-implementation-of-signature-and-delegation-business-module" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.7.1 Implementation of Signature and Delegation Business Module</strong></h3> <p>  Java ScriptEngineManager is a JS engine implemented in Java that can call the

monitoring. The getTopSupervise(Blockchain) method is called to send the payment
chain to the top node, and the top node signature returns whether the payment
chain was signed by the top node and is not overspent.If you overspend, call the
arbitration module to initiate arbitration. Call getUnisuoervise (Blockchain) to
check if the payment chain in the aggregated data is valid.</p> <h3 id="_3-7-4-implementation-of-arbitration-module"><a href="#_3-7-4-implementation-of-arbitration-module" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.7.4 Implementation of arbitration module</strong></h3> <p>  Chats detected on non-top nodes call doToparBitRate (Blockchain) to arbitrate
through the top node.If the top node is found to be involved in cheating, call
DouniarBitRate (BlockChanin) to initiate the aggregation node arbitration
transaction.After DouniarBitRate is initiated, it notifies other nodes in a
recursive way. Once the evidence is confirmed, any guarantee service node will
stop the guarantee service from participating in the arbitration affairs until
the arbitration is completed.The mediation process starts after the execution of
the aggregation algorithm and can be queried by any participating node in the
whole network.</p> <h3 id="_3-8-performance-evaluation"><a href="#_3-8-performance-evaluation" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.8 Performance Evaluation</strong></h3> <p>  This performance evaluation includes two dimensions, namely, the horizontal

consensus. The main purpose of this evaluation is to verify whether the GC
consensus algorithm can achieve the horizontal expansion of TPS.</p> <h3 id="_3-8-1-concept-of-performance-evaluation"><a href="#_3-8-1-concept-of-performance-evaluation" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.8.1 Concept of performance evaluation</strong></h3> <p>  The evaluation is based on the completely reliable method of GC consensus
algorithm, that is, each transaction initiates the aggregate data request and
waits for the completion of the aggregate to be a transaction
completed.Theoretically, a completely reliable transaction needs to wait for the
completion of the aggregate data, and the aggregation algorithm is actively
executed by all nodes. That is to say, there is no direct transaction
restriction in the consensus dimension, and the restriction comes from hardware
and software indicators.</p> <h3 id="_3-8-2-purpose-of-performance-test"><a href="#_3-8-2-purpose-of-performance-test" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.8.2 Purpose of performance test</strong></h3> <p>  Test whether the system performance can be horizontally optimized under a small

system of arbitration and the accountability mechanism to ensure the
traceability of solution of the data, do not tamper with the characteristics of
such a design pattern is in conformity with the production rules, value to
drive, community of roles involved in the system as a whole, different
liability, respectively, in the aspect of software solutions for coupling, the
overall consensus forming uniform rules, and make the system capacity is not
limited to the function of each node implementations can cluster deployment, In
the field of pay, to pay extremely high efficiency and safety requirements, the
currency of the consensus characteristic determines the only within multiple
branches accepted the transaction can be considered to be effective, but the
time need more than 10 minutes, so in daily life slow trading is not recognized,
this alone determines the COINS to be money, can't build request response
results of the upper application in 10 minutes, and resource oriented
architecture will be eliminated, unable to become mainstream, GC consensus
algorithm on the chain of responsibility as a security data not been tampered
with, in line with the rate of production rules, its capacity can be associated
with hardware optimization.Not limited to the consensus itself. But GC consensus
algorithm in not registered in the system completely reliable relies on the
execution of the aggregation algorithm, but the aggregation algorithm
implementation of frequency is limited by the single node hardware and software
environment, the higher the frequency of execution means that the higher the
system load, when the load is limited by hardware, will not be able to achieve
high throughput, high-performance aggregated data in GC2.0 version can revolve
around this problem, the study, improve production efficiency of GC chain.</p> <p>reference</p> <ol><li><p>Zhang Liucheng, Zhang Li, Yang Weizhi. Overview of Blockchain Technology
